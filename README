The internetbazar board system

- based on symfony 1.2.7, propel orm
- supports russian and ukrainian languages
System requirements:
  - Only tested with Ubuntu Linux but should work with other Linux / UNIX
    dialects. 
  - PHP >= 5.2
  - Mysql >= 5.0
  - Apache2 web server
  

Configuration
- In production mode. Replace config/app.yml with config/app_prod.yml
  (change its name to "app.yml")
- Dont deploy frontend_dev.php and backeend.dev.php to production
  server! They can be found in the "additionals" folder, and should only reside under the "web" directory during development.
- For admin to work locally, run the sf_user sql script from the additionals folder.
- Run the "temp_image_info.sql" script in the additionals folder.
  This is to create a log of every deleted image, so they can be 
  deleted physically at a later stage (see the ImageCleaner task).
- Database settings are found here: additionals/database.yml
  They should be moved to the config folder. They are in the additionals folder only to prevent deploying the wrong settings to production.
- The main sql script is found here: data/sql/lib.model.schema.sql
  It is generated every time you run the command: symfony propel:build-sql 
- Make sure you have defined a separate database for tests in database.yml
  (in order for unit tests to work)
- There are unit tests and selenium tests checked in under the "test" dir.
- Install this for apache in order for some urls to work:
  install module rewrite : a2enmod rewrite
- Make sure image library gt is installed: apt-get install php5-gd
- An example apache config file (for local use) can be found in the 
  additionals dir.
- Make sure to create a "log" and "cache" directory in the root
  with permissions 777.
- See the file "crontab.txt" in the additionals folder to see what crontab settings to use in production environment.
